- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kiawr new to programming languages.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I just finished the video tutorial for HTML and am now doing the CSS.
- 💞️ I'm looking for someone that can mentor or guide me. I can do free coding for 2 to 4 hours in return.
- 📫 You can reach me on this email address kiawr.lacanienta@gmail.com.
